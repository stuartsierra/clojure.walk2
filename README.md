# clojure.walk2

A reimplementation of the `clojure.walk` namespace.

Submitted as an enhancement to Clojure in [CLJ-1239](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1239).

**This repo is for demonstration only.**
All further development/discussion should happen on
[Clojure's JIRA](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1239)
and [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure).

Differences from the original `clojure.walk`:

* Protocol-based dispatch for better performance

* Support for records (also implemented for the old clojure.walk
  in [CLJ-1105](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1105),
  applied in Clojure 1.6)



## Releases and Dependency Information

No binary releases.

Run `lein install` in this directory, then use this dependency in a Leiningen project:

    [com.stuartsierra/clojure.walk2 "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]



## Usage

    (require '[clojure.walk2 :as walk])

The public API is identical to that of `clojure.walk`.

See [clojure.walk API documentation](http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.walk-api.html)



## Tests

In this directory, run `lein test`. The test suite is the same as that
for `clojure.walk`, with some added tests for records.



## Benchmarks

In this directory, start a repl with `lein repl` and then:

    (require 'bench)
    (bench/bench 5)

Pass different numbers to `bench/bench` to run the test with different
random seeds. Call `bench/data` with the same random seed to see the
test data.

In my tests, `clojure.walk2` is about 2 times faster than
`clojure.walk`.
